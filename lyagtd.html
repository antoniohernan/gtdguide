</div>

<h1>What is “GTD”?</h1>

<p>GTD – or “Getting things done” – is a framework for organising
and tracking your tasks and projects.  Its aim is a bit higher than just
“getting things done”, though.  (It should have been called “Getting things
done in a much better way than just letting things happen, which often turns out
not to be very cool at all”.)  Its aim is to make you have 100% trust in a
system for collecting tasks, ideas, and projects – both vague things like
<span class="action">“invent greatest thing ever”</span> and concrete things
like <span class="action">“call Ada 25 August to discuss cheesecake
recipe”</span>.  Everything!</p>

<p>Sound like all other run-of-the-mill to-do list systems, you say? Well in
many ways it is, but there is more to it, and it's really simple.  Promise! So
please read on...</p>

<p>One of the basic assumptions of GTD is that you are dumb – or rather,
that your subconsciousness is quite dumb when it comes to thinking about things
you <i>should</i> have done.  Like knowing you need to buy more flour and sugar,
but forgetting to remind you when you actually are in the store.</p>

<p>A great part of the “magic” is to convert both tasks and whims into
<i>physical</i> and <i>visible</i> <strong>actions</strong>.</p>

<p>What GTD gives you – when understood and implemented properly –
is a foolproof system for keeping track of what you need to do, should do, or
should consider to do <i>so your subconsciousness doesn't have to</i>.  This
reduces stress, frees up precious brain time to come up with creative thoughts,
and may even save <i>real</i> time so that you have more time for ballet
lessons, painting class, roller-blading, or whatever you kids do these days.</p>

<!--
Having a total and seamless system of organisation in place gives you tremendous
power because it allows your mind to let go of lower-level thinking and graduate
to intuitive focusing, undistracted by matters that haven't been dealt with
appropriately. But your physicl organisation system must be better than your
mental one in order for that to happen.
-->

<img src="images/lists.png" alt="lists!" style="width: 30%" />
<p>Awesome! So how does it actually work? By using special yoga techniques and
daily mental exercises.  No, haha! Just kidding.  It works by maintaining lists,
which every kid with paper and a pencil can do, even computers can maintain
lists these days!</p>

<p>You will have to make the following lists:</p>

<ul>
    <li> <span class="listname">In</span></li>
    <li> <span class="listname">Next actions</span> (probably several)</li>
    <li> <span class="listname">Waiting for</span></li>
    <li> <span class="listname">Projects</span></li>
    <li> <span class="listname">Some day/maybe</span></li>
</ul>

<p>These lists will be reviewed regularly and form the backbone of the GTD system.
Their workings are described below.  In addition to the lists you will need a
<span class="calendar">calendar</span> which lets you write down both date and time
bound tasks/events.</p>

<div class="important">
<p>This run-through of the GTD method is meant to be brief. It's written from one
person's perspective and other people would probably assess the importance of
different aspects of GTD differently.</p>

<p>If you want a complete overview of GTD you would be wise to read David
Allen's book which formalised the method he developed: <strong>“Getting Things
Done: The Art of Stress-Free Productivity”</strong> (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0142000280?ie=UTF8&tag=erlehamb-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0142000280">Amazon – Paperback</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=erlehamb-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0142000280" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />,

<h1>THE “<span class="listname">IN</span>“ LIST</h1>

<p>The <span class="listname">in</span> list is where you capture ideas and
tasks as they occur to you.  Either by your boss telling you to bake her a
carrot cake, or by you seeing a poster for a circus you want to see.  The
barrier for adding something to your <span class="listname">in</span> list
should be as low as possible – jot it down in a notebook or press the right
buttons on your pocket telephone.  While I have called it <i>the</i> <span
class="listname">in</span> list, It is no problem to have more than one.  Maybe
a computer program for when you are in front of a computer and a notebook for
when you loiter outside the mall?  The important thing is that you are able to
write down things as they occur to you.  We want to offload work from the brain,
remember?</p>

<p>When you first start to use GTD you should take an hour to write down all
things you want to – or have to – do.  These <i>open loops</i> as Allen calls
them include <i>all</i> things that aren't as they should be or where they
should be.  Do you need to replace your toothbrush? Return the tea cup you
borrowed from your aunt Trillian? Should you repaint your bed in another colour?
All these things should go on your <span class="listname">in</span> list.</p>


<h1>PROCESSING THE “<span class="listname">IN</span>” LIST</h1>

<div class="remember">
    If you have just started to use GTD and collected tonnes of items in your
    <span class="listname">in</span> list during the initial “brain-emptying”,
    this process can take a while.  However, after this the <span
    class="listname">in</span> list will be processed continuously.
</div>

<p>The items on your <span class="listname">in</span> list should be processed
one by one in the order they appear on your list.  When processing at an item in
your <span class="listname">in</span> list the first question you need to ask is
<strong>is it actionable?</strong> – in other words, do you need to <i>do</i>
something?  If the answer is NO, you either throw it away if you no longer need
it, keep it as reference material (“I will probably need this article again some
day...“), add it to a ”some day/maybe list” (for things like <span
class="action">“learn Indonesian”</span>), or <strong>incubate</strong> it.
Wait, what! Sit on it?  Yes, sort of.  If it's something that you want to remind
yourself of later (“I really didn't understand this article, I should have a
look at it again in two weeks”) it should go into your calendar or your tickler
file.  Don't know what a tickler file is?  Worry not, it is introduced below and
its weird name explained.</p>

<p>Now, if the item you're currently processing <i>is</i> actionable – in other
words: something should be done about it – you should ask the question “<i>what
is the next action?</i>”  <strong>The next action needs to be a
<i>physical</i> and <i>visible</i> action</strong>.  In other words, not <span
class="action">“plan cake lottery”</span>, but <span class="action">“e-mail
Arthur and Camille and remind them to bake their cakes”</span>.</p>

<div class="important">
    This very thing – that next actions should be the next <strong>physical,
    visible</strong> action to move the project closer to its goal – is perhaps
    <i>the</i> most important “rule” in GTD.  By using a few extra seconds to
    come up with what <i>physically</i> needs to be done, you make sure that
    your “next action” lists will only contain the things you can choose to do
    at any moment.  The “pre-processing” has already been done (the actions
    themselves may very well be planning tasks, though) and this greatly lowers
    the resistance to <i>do</i> the things.
</div>

<p>When you have determined the next action you should consider if it takes two
minutes or less to do it.  If it does, do it right away.  (Things like and <span
class="action">“e-mail funny cat video to grandma”</span>.)  The reason for this
is simple: if the action takes two minutes or less, the overhead of tracking it
will be very large compared to how long it takes to just <i>do</i> it.  If it
takes more than two minutes you should <strong>delegate</strong> it if
appropriate – noting what was delegated and when on a <span
class="listname">waiting for</span> list, or add it to your own <span
class="listname">next actions</span> list.  Unless your secret superpower is
delegation, this is probably where most things will end up.</p>

<p>To summarise, when processing your <span class="listname">in</span> list(s),
you should follow this procedure:</p>

<div class="important">
<ul>
    <li>If the item is NOT “actionable”:</li>
         Throw it away, archive it for future reference, or put it on your “some
         day/maybe” list.
    <li>If item IS “actionable”:</li>
        <ul>
             <li>Work out the next physical, visible action.</li>
             <li>If this action will it take 2 minutes or less:</li>
                  Do it!
             <li>If this action will it take more than 2 minutes:</li>
                <ul>
                  <li>Delegate it and add it to your <span class="listname">waiting for</span> list.</li>
                  OR
                  <li>Add it to your <span class="listname">next actions</span> list of things to be done.</li>
                </ul>
        </ul>
</ul>
</div>

<h1>THE “<span class="listname">NEXT ACTIONS</span>” LIST</h1>

<p>So what's the <span class="listname">next actions</span> list?  Well, uh, a
list of your next actions, obviously.  Another name for these actions is
“as-soon-as-possible actions” – it is simply those things from which you will
pick out what to work on when you are not watching funny cat videos on Youtube
or playing Farmville.</p>


<h1>THE “<span class="listname">WAITING FOR</span>” LIST</h1>

<p>When you delegate work to others, send an e-mail you expect or need to be
replied to, order something, or have a task that is “blocked” because you are
waiting for someone else to do something, it should be written down on your
<span class="listname">waiting for</span> list.  These items should always be
stamped with the current date so that you'll be able to e-mail your co-worker
Marvin and say “I'm still waiting for the WTF report you said you'd finish
within a month.  That was 32 days ago!”.</p>

<h1>PROJECTS</h1>

<p>If your still with me you might have worried that a <span
class="action">“research artificial intelligence textbooks”</span> action on
your <span class="listname">next actions</span> list is all that is written down
about your plan to take over the world.  Wouldn't it be easy to lose track once
that action is done and erased from your list? Yes, it kinda would...  That's
where the <span class="listname">projects</span> list comes in.</p>

<p>GTD's definition of a project is very broad.  It defines any objective that
requires more than one action as a project.  These projects should go on your
<span class="listname">projects</span> list.  This list is simply a list of
project titles and – if you like – descriptions and intended outcomes of the
projects.</p>

<h1>CONTEXTS</h1>

<img src="images/computer.png" alt="computer!" style="width: 30%" />

<p>Contexts are “tags” you put on the items on your <span class="listname">next
actions</span> lists saying where the action can be done, or what equipment you
need to perform it.  An action can be “tagged” with a context in several ways;
the easiest is probably to simply have different <span class="listname">next
actions</span> lists – one for each context. If you use a new-fangled electronic
list manager you can often have “smart” lists for each tags – giving the same
result. (With so-called smartphones it's probably even possible to use its
location awareness to only present actions whose context match your current
location. If so: that is amazing! We live in the future!)</p>

<p>It is common to prefix contexts with an ‛@’ which makes sense when the
context is a location, but should just be thought of as a notation in other
cases. Examples of contexts are <span
class="context">@ home</span>, <span class="context">@ computer</span>, and
<span class="context">@ office</span>.  

<h3>Examples of actions and their contexts</h3>

<div class="example">
<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Action</th>
        <th>Context</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><span class="action">Buy more rainbow-coloured dog food</span></td>
        <td><span class="context">@ city</span> or <span class="context">@ store</span></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><span class="action">Browse cuteoverload.com</span></td>
        <td><span class="context">@ computer</span> or <span class="context">@
        the world wide webs</span></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><span class="action">Smile to a stranger</span></td>
        <td><span class="context">@ everywhere</span></td> 
    </tr>
</table>
</div>

<p>How many contexts you need depend on how many next actions you will have and
how your work day looks like.  The important thing is to be able to assess – at
a glance – what your possible actions are depending on where you physically are
and what equipment you have available.  It can also be a good idea to make an
“everywhere” context for things you can do no matter where you are (“FOO”).</p>

<h2>AGENDA CONTEXTS</h2>

If you have regular meetings with people, it can be benefitial to have “agenda
contexts” – one for each person – where you write down the things you want to
talk about during the next meeting as they occur. For example, if you have a
weekly meeting with Foobert, you might consider having a “<span
class="context">@ Foobert Agenda</span>” context.  These contexts will of course change along with
changing teams/managers/supervisor, etc.


<h1>THE “<span class="listname">SOME DAY/MAYBE</span>” LIST</h1>

<p>You don't want to lose your million-dollar idea of making a “jumping to
conclusions” mat that lets people jump to conclusions, but since this is a
project you want to realise when you have more time you don't want to have it
“pollute” your <span class="listname">next actions</span> lists or your list of
<span class="listname">projects</span> either. (Remember that the <span
class="listname">next actions</span> only contains the things that should be
done as soon as possible and that your <span class="listname">projects</span>
list will be reviewed regularily to make sure that all projects have at least
one next action.)</p>

<p>This is where the <span class="listname">some day/maybe</span> list comes it.
This list simply contains ideas and projects you <i>might</i> want to realise at
some time in the future. This is where both <span class="action">“replace ugly
painting in bed room”</span>
and <span class="action">“start a cult”</span> should go. (Assuming – of course – that you don't want to do
either of those things right now.)</p>


<h1>CALENDAR</h1>

<p>The <span class="calendar">calendar</span> is for things you <i>have</i> to do
on a certain date or at a certain time, and <i>nothing else</i>!  That's right;
no putting <span class="action">“install Bonzibudddy“</span> on your calendar
for next Wednesday if you just <i>now</i> think you <i>want</i> to have it done
then.</p>

<p>Why?  By only having items which really are time and date sensitive on your
<span class="calendar">calendar</span> it will be more useful since it will
actually tell you the things you <i>have</i> to do a certain day without being
“dilluded“ with other items.  The thing you <i>want</i> to do will be on your
<span class="listname">next actions</span> list any way, so you will be reminded
about it and have the chance to do it anyway if you have the time.</p>

<h1>WEEKLY REVIEW</h1>

<p>Allen calls this a “critical factor for success”</p>


<h1>GETTING IT TO WORK</h1>

<p>To actually get your GTD system to work there are some important “rules” to
follow.  ...</p>

<p>It is important that you have <strong>hard edges</strong> between your lists,
and between your <span class="listname">next actions</span> lists.</p>

<h1>READ/REVIEW FOLDER</h1>

<h1>TICKLER FILE</h1>

<img src="images/tickle.png" alt="tickle!" style="width: 30%" />
<p>This strangely-named concept is simply a collection of 43 file folders. Why
43? Because that means that you can have one for each of the <strong>31</strong>
days of a month plus one for each of the <strong>12</strong> months of the year.</p>
